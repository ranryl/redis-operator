                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,

                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                        specified.
                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                        in any namespaces.
                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.

                          Exit status of 0 is treated as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy.

                      dataSource field can be used to specify either:
                      * An existing VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot)
                      * An existing PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)
                      If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source,
                      it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.
                      When the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled, dataSource contents will be copied to dataSourceRef,
                      and dataSourceRef contents will be copied to dataSource when dataSourceRef.namespace is not specified.
                      If the namespace is specified, then dataSourceRef will not be copied to dataSource.

                      dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                      provisioner.
                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                        specified.
                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                        in any namespaces.

                      dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                      provisioner.
                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                        specified.
                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                        in any namespaces.

                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                      dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                      provisioner.
                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                        specified.
                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                        in any namespaces.
                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
